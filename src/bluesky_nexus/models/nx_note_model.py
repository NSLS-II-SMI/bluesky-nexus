Module: nx_note_model

This module defines the `NXnoteModel` class, which represents a model for storing 
and managing notes in the context of a Nexus data format. It is part of the 
Bluesky Nexus implementation, which is designed to manage experimental data 
and metadata in a structured and extensible way. 

The `NXnoteModel` class is used to describe a note, which can contain textual 
or binary data, and include metadata such as author, creation date, content type, 
file name, description, and a sequence index for ordering multiple notes. 

Classes:
    NXnoteModel: A model that represents a note, containing attributes such as 
                author, date, type, description, sequence index, and binary data.

    NXnoteModel represents a note in the Nexus data format, containing metadata 
    and binary or textual data. It is designed to store information such as the 
    author, creation date, MIME type, file name, description, sequence order, 
    and the note's content (either as text or binary data). 

    This model is part of the Bluesky Nexus system, which is used to organize 
    and manage experimental data. Each `NXnoteModel` instance can be associated 
    with a specific note that may contain any form of data, including images, 
    text, or other formats, along with relevant metadata.

    Attributes:
        default (NXattrModel): The default attribute, initially set to "author".
        author (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): The author or creator 
               of the note.
        date (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): The date the note 
              was created or added.
        type (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): The MIME type of the 
              note data (e.g., "image/jpeg", "text/plain").
        file_name (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): The original 
                  file name if the note was read from an external file.
        description (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): A brief 
                    description or title of the note.
        sequence_index (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): The index 
                         of the note in a sequence of notes (starting from 1).
        data (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): The binary or textual 
              data of the note.
        model_config (ConfigDict): Configuration settings for the model, allowing 
                                   arbitrary types and forbidding extra fields.
