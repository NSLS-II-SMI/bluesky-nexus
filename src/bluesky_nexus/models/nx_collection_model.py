Module: nx_collection_model.py

This module defines the `NXcollectionModel`, a specialized extension of `NXgroupModel` 
for representing collections of NeXus groups within a scientific dataset. It provides 
flexibility for handling arbitrary types while ensuring compatibility with NeXus standards.

### Features:
- **Extends NXgroupModel**: Inherits all properties and validation rules of `NXgroupModel`.
- **Arbitrary Type Support**: Uses `ConfigDict` to allow additional types and properties.
- **Flexible Structure**: Designed to accommodate complex NeXus collections.

### Main Model:
- `NXcollectionModel`: A subclass of `NXgroupModel` with extended configurability.

This module is intended to provide a structured approach to handling NeXus collections 
within data processing workflows.
