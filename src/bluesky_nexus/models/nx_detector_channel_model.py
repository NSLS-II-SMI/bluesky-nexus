Module: nx_detector_channel_model.py

This module defines the Pydantic model for the NXdetector_channel group in the NeXus format. 
The NXdetector_channel group is used to store data related to individual detector channels, 
including threshold energy, flat field correction, pixel masks, and saturation values.

The NXdetector_channelModel class structures and validates the contents of an NXdetector_channel 
group to ensure compliance with NeXus conventions.

Classes:
- NXdetector_channelModel: Represents an individual detector channel with properties related 
  to energy thresholds, corrections, and data validity.

Key Features:
- Supports threshold energy definition for photon detection.
- Includes fields for flat field correction and pixel masks.
- Stores saturation and underload values to define the valid measurement range.
- Ensures structured validation for NeXus compliance.

    """
    Represents an NXdetector_channel group in the NeXus format. This group stores metadata 
    and calibration information for an individual detector channel, including threshold energy, 
    flat field correction, pixel masks, and saturation limits.

    Attributes:
        threshold_energy (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            The energy threshold at which a photon will be recorded.
        flatfield_applied (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            Indicates whether the flat field correction has been applied in the electronics (True or False).
        flatfield (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            The response of each pixel given a constant input.
        flatfield_errors (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            Errors associated with the flat field correction data.
        pixel_mask_applied (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            Indicates whether the pixel mask correction has been applied in the electronics (True or False).
        pixel_mask (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            Custom pixel mask for this channel. May include nP as the first dimension 
            for masks that vary for each scan point.
        saturation_value (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            The value at which the detector becomes saturated. Data above this value is considered invalid.
        underload_value (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): 
            The lowest value at which pixels for this detector would be reasonably measured. 
            Data below this value is considered invalid.
