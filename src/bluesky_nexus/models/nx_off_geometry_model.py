Module: nx_off_geometry_model

This module defines the `NXoff_geometryModel`, which represents the geometry data
for 3D objects in the Nexus data format, specifically for storing and organizing
data related to 3D models in the OFF (Object File Format) structure. The model
contains information about the vertices, faces, and other geometric properties
of the 3D object, such as the winding order and detector face association.

It is used within the Bluesky Nexus framework to store experimental data related
to the geometry of objects used in scientific experiments, such as detectors,
scattering objects, or other relevant components in 3D space.

Classes:
    NXoff_geometryModel (NXgroupModel):
        A class that models the geometry of 3D objects in the OFF format.

    """
    NXoff_geometryModel represents the geometric data for a 3D object in the
    OFF format, which is used to store information about vertices, faces, and
    their relationships. This class is structured to support the storage of
    detailed geometric properties of the object, including the winding order of
    the faces and detector face associations.

    The model includes:
        - Vertices: The 3D coordinates of the vertices that make up the object.
        - Winding Order: The indices of the vertices that define the face in the
          correct order (right-hand rule for normal).
        - Faces: The face indices that define the shape of the object.
        - Detector Faces: Associations between faces and detector IDs.

    Attributes:
        default (NXattrModel): The default attribute for the geometry model,
                                set to "faces".
        vertices (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): A list of 3D
                  coordinates (x, y, z) for the vertices of the object.
        winding_order (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): A list of
                      vertex indices used to form each face, following the
                      right-hand rule for the face normal.
        faces (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): A list that indicates
               the start index in `winding_order` for each face.
        detector_faces (Optional[NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString]): A list of
                        pairs of indices in the `faces` dataset and the
                        corresponding detector ID.
        model_config (ConfigDict): Configuration for the model, allowing
                                   arbitrary types and forbidding extra fields.
