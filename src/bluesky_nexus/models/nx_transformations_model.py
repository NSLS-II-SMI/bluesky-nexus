Module: nx_transformations_model

This module defines the `NXtransformationsModel`, which is used to describe
the transformations applied to a set of data in the Nexus format. Specifically,
the model captures information about geometric transformations, such as
translations and rotations, that are applied to an axis or a set of axes.

The model allows for the specification of the type of transformation, the
axis of transformation, the vector defining the axis, and other relevant
parameters such as offsets, units, and dependencies. It is structured to
represent transformations in the context of experimental setups, such as
detectors, equipment components, or other related transformations in scientific
experiments.

Classes:
    NXtransformationsModel (NXgroupModel):
        A class representing transformations, such as translation and rotation,
        in an experimental setup. The transformation is defined by attributes
        like the transformation type, vector, offset, and associated equipment.

    AXISNAMEModel (NXfieldModelWithPrePostRunString):
        A model that represents the specifics of the axis on which the
        transformation is applied. Includes attributes like transformation type,
        vector, offset, and equipment component.

    NXtransformationsModel represents geometric transformations applied to data
    in an experimental context. This includes transformations like translation
    (linear displacements) and rotation (angular rotations) along specific axes.
    The transformations are parameterized by axis definitions, vectors, offsets,
    and additional configuration details, such as dependencies on other fields or
    components of the equipment.

    Attributes:
        default (NXattrModel): The default attribute for the transformation model,

        AXISNAME (Optional[AXISNAMEModel]): A model that describes a specific axis
